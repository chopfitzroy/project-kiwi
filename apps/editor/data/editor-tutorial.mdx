# Tutorial ðŸŽ“

First time using the editor? No worries we've got you covered.

The editor uses a language called [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which allows us to mix plain text with custom components like `<Skill />` to create a rich editing experience.

## Finding IDs

Most custom components will require an `id` attribute in order to tell the component which item/skill/etc... it needs to look up.

Finding the ID's can be a bit difficult, fortunately [Discretize](https://discretize.eu/) have developed a useful [lookup tool](https://discretize.eu/editor/ids/) for finding ID's more easily.

If you can't find what you are looking for with the [lookup tool](https://discretize.eu/editor/ids/) you can always resort to the [Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page).

When using the [Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page) you will need to go to the item/skill/etc... i.e [Winter's Bite](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Winter%27s_Bite) and find the info box picured below:

![Wiki info box](/images/editor-tutorial/infobox.png "Wiki info box")

Next to the **External links** section you will see a link to the [API](https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/skills?ids=12490) this will open the raw API response that the [Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page) uses to get information about that skill.

Once you have opened the [API](https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/skills?ids=12490) link i.e  `https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/skills?ids=12490` you can get the item/skill/etc... ID from the URL using the `ids=12490` portion of the URL where `12490` is the ID.

Alternatively you can read through the response on that page and find a section (normally near the bottom) that will look like this:

```json
"id": 12490,
```

Where `12490` is the ID.

## Custom Components

### Skill

The `<Skill />` component is used to display a single skill, i.e a heal skill, weapon skill, utilitly skill, etc...

The only required attribute is an `id`.

```jsx
<Skill id="12490" />
```

For a complete list of the available attributes please see [here](https://discretize.github.io/discretize-ui/?path=/docs/components-skill--lava-font).
